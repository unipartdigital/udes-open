## Models

In general the functions are designed to be as simple as possible, where they do one thing well. 
One reason why update picking has not been migrated over, as it is just a lot of if statements

### MixinStockModel (model: mixin.stock.model)
This model is used to include generic functions that are inherited by various models in udes_stock.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------ |
| MSM_CREATE   | boolean | Whether it can create a new object which the method is called from, e.g product, group etc. Set to False by default |
| MSM_STR_DOMAIN | tuple(string) | Tuple of strings in which to search for/create the object |

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- | 
| _get_msm_domain | Gets the domain
| get_or_create | Gets an object of the model from the identifier. In case that no results are found, creates a new object of the model depending on the create parameter and the MSM_CREATE setting.


### Products (model: product.product)

Products are the actual items we want to handle. These can be car parts, mobile phones or plant pots.

Additional Details:
- Inherits from: mixin.stock.model

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| MSM_STR_DOMAIN | tuple(string) | What get_or_create uses to search for products with |
| active     | string | How the product is tracked in the system. This is used for serial lots. |

### Product Template (model: product.template)

| Field Name | Description |
| ---------- |  -------- |
| active | string | Tracking enabled on change |
| name | Disable translation instead of renaming |
| type | Enable products to be stockable |

### Locations (model: stock.location)

The warehouse is made up of various locations for storing stock. There are two main types of locations - stock, and non-stock locations. Stock typically represents all the warehouse storage of products that can be sent to customers. The other locations typically represent transition stages around receiving goods and sending goods out to customers.

Additional Details:
- Additionally Inherits from: mixin.stock.model and mail.thread

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | int | Disable translation instead of renaming |
| active | [{stock.quants}] | Add tracking or archiving |

### Quants (model: stock.quant)

Physical instances of products at a location are modelled as quants. Short of "quantities of stock", these are used to record stock levels are various parts of the warehouse. Using the analogy of object-orientated programming, products = classes, quants = objects.

Additional Details:
- Change _description to 'Quant'

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- | 
| _gather | Calls default gather function, if quant_ids context variable is set the resulting quants are filtered by id. |
| get_quantity | Returns the total quantity of the quants in self |
| get_quantities_by_key | Returns a dictionary with the total quantity per product, mapped by product_id |
| create_picking | Create a picking from Quants |

### Packages (model: stock.quant.package)

Physical packages of products. They can be used to represent parcels sent to customers, a pallet of products sent from a supplier, a tote used to pick products so they can be sent, or any combination of the above.

Additional Details:
- Change _description to o780 mikyl8"Package"
- Additionally Inherits from: mixin.stock.model

| Field Name   | Description | Value |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------ | 
| MSM_CREATE   | Can create new packages | True |

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| get_quantities_by_key | This function computes the product quantities for the given package grouped by a key |
| mls_can_fulfil | Returns mls which the package can fulfil. If the product_qty of the mls is larger than in the package (i.e. in self) the mls will be split |
| has_same_content | Compare the content of packages with other packages | 
| find_move_lines | Find move lines related to the package. Expects a singleton package. |
| get_reserved_quantity | Returns the quantity in package that is reserved | 
| create_picking | Create a picking from package |

### Stock Picking (model: stock.picking)

This is essentially a collection of products that are to be moved from one location to another.

| Field Name | Type    | Description |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| sequence | int | Used to order the 'All Operations' kanban view |
| u_first_picking_ids | one2many (stock.picking) | Shows the pickings at the top of the chain |
| u_prev_picking_ids | one2many (stock.picking) | Shows the previous pickings in the chain |
| u_next_picking_ids | one2many (stock.picking) | Shows the next pickings in the chain |
| u_created_backorder_ids | one2many (stock.picking) | Shows backorders created from this picking |
| u_quantity_done | float | Sums all done move quantities for the picking |
| u_total_quantity | float | Sums all move quantities for the picking |
| u_has_discrepancies | boolean | Flags when u_quantity_done doesn't match u_total_quantity |
| u_num_pallets | int | Sums all unique destination packages found in the picking's move lines |

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| get_empty_locations | Returns the recordset of locations that are child of the instance dest location and are empty.Expects a singleton instance. |
| _get_child_dest_locations | Return the child locations of the instance dest location. Extra domains are added to the child locations search query, when specified. Expects a singleton instance. |
| get_move_lines | Get move lines associated to picking, uses functions in stock_move_line. |
| _backorder_move_lines | Creates a backorder pick from self (expects a singleton) and a subset of stock.move.lines are then moved into it. |
| _requires_backorder | Checks if a backorder is required by checking if all move lines within a picking are present in mls. Cannot be consolidated with _check_backorder in Odoo core, because it does not take into account any move lines parameter. |
| _prepare_picking_info | Prepare the picking_info and products_info, returning the picking_info as a list of pickings, and products_info None or as a list of lists of a dictionary of the product info. This is to allow us to create multiple pickings at once. |
| _prepare_move | Return a list of the move details to be used later in creation of the move(s). Note: pickings and products_info should be formatted via _prepare_picking_info. Allows for multiple moves to be created at once. | 
| _create_batch | Creates a batch |
| create_picking | Create and return a picking for the given picking_type. For multiple pickings a list of lists of dicts of product_info should be passed, and pickings with the same picking_type and other kwargs are the same. The kwargs are applied to pickings, not moves. If needed, the moves can be created outside of create_pickings with _create_moves. |
| _create_move | Create and return move(s) for the given move_values. Should be used in conjunction with _prepare_move to obtain move_values |


### Picking Type (model: stock.picking.type)

The type of stock.picking can is defined by this type. It can represent a goods in, a putaway, an internal transfer, a pick, a goods out, or any other collection of stock moves the warehouse operators want to model within UDES.

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| get_action_picking_tree_draft | Used to enable draft picks in the UI |

### Stock Move (model: stock.move)

A move of an item of stock from one location to another.

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| _unreserve_initial_demand | Override stock default function to keep the old move lines, so there is no need to create them again. |
| split_out_move_lines | Split sufficient quantity from self to cover move_lines, and attach move_lines to the new move. Return the move that now holds all of move_lines. If self is completely covered by move_lines, it will be removed from its picking and returned. |


### Stock Move Line (model: stock.move.line)

A move of a specific, handleable item of stock - such as 5 phones, or 1 car door.

| Field Name | Description |
| ---------- |------------ |
| u_picking_type_id | Operation Type |

| Helpers | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| get_lines_incomplete | Return the move lines in self that are not completed, i.e., quantity done < quantity to do. |
| get_lines_done | Return the move lines in self that are completed, i.e., quantity done >= quantity to do. |
| move_lines_for_qty | Return a subset of move lines from self where their sum of quantity to do is equal to parameter quantity. In case that a move line needs to be split, the new move line is also returned (this happens when total quantity in the move lines is greater than quantity parameter). If there is not enough quantity to do in the move lines, also return the remaining quantity. |
| _get_search_domain | Generate search domain for a given move line. |
| get_quants | Returns the quants related to move lines in self. |
| get_quantities_by_key | This function computes the different product quantities for the given move lines. |
| sort_by_key | Return the move lines sorted by location and product. |
