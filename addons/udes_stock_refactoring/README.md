# UDES Stock Refactoring
UDES Stock Refactoring module refactors picks by merging pickings or splitting them depending on the grouping key.
The module contains different ways how handles the refactoring:
1. It is done automatically depending on configuration that is set on the picking type.
2. Default Refactoring by triggering the configuration on picking type with a wizard by selecting one or multi records(moves, picks or batches) with the needed picking type to be refactored.
3. Custom Refactoring by selecting one or multi records(moves, picks or batches) with the needed picking type to be refactored and specifying the group key in the wizard.
  The selected grouping factor should have a configuration set up on the picking type even if is not automatically triggered on flow change.
## Default settings

- data/picking_types.xml
    - Goods OUT (stock.picking_type_out)
    - Putaway (udes_stock.picking_type_putaway)

## Requires
- udes_common:
  Because imports RegistryMeta from models/registry used when defining refactor abstract classes
- stock_picking_batch:
  The reason is as in module functionalities are included refactoring of stock picking batches ,
  and the model is defined in stock_picking_batch module.
- base:
  Access rights are not defined yet but still in order to see new models, agreed to assign to System User group.
  Group is defined in base module.
- udes_stock:
  Is inheriting putaway picking type which is defined in udes_stock module.

There are other modules which are required and they got added automatically by dependence hierarchy

## Models
In general the functions are designed to be as simple as possible, where they do one thing well.
