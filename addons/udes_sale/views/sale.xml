            <p>
            An order is to upsell when delivered quantities are above initially
            ordered quantities, and the invoicing policy is based on ordered quantities.
          </p>
            <p>
            As an example, if you sell pre-paid hours of services, UDES recommends you
            to sell extra hours when all ordered hours have been consumed.
