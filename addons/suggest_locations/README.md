# Suggested Locations

Module to handle suggested locations

# Dependencies
- base
- get_info 
- udes_common (requires groupby)
- udes_stock (requires get_empty children)

# Policies (u_suggest_location_policy)

Policies are based on a metaclass that enforces the methods needed for suggested locations to work. Essentially they are used to govern how stock is moved within a warehouse, along with the u_drop_location_constaint.

| Policy | Description |
| - | - |
| ByProduct | Match drop locations to locations with existing products of the same type are |

# Drop Configurations (u_drop_location_constaint)

For flexibility there are a range of different configurations on which locations items can be dropped in a warehouse, ranging from ones where no checks are done giving the user freedom of choice, to ones that are more restrictive and only allow the item to be dropped in a particular set of locations. 

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| do_not_scan | Don't require scanning the destination location |
| scan | The user has complete autonomy and scans the destination location which is chosen by the user |
| suggest | A user is given suitable locations (not empty) to drop the items based on the current policy, but ultimately can choose where they drop it |
| suggest_with_empty | A user is given suitable locations (including empty ones) to drop the items based on the current policy, but ultimately can choose where they drop it  |
| enforce | A user must drop the items in a suggested location (cannot be empty) based on the policy. User has no autonomy on where stock should be placed |
| enforce_with_empty | A user must drop the items in a suggested location (including empty locations) based on the policy. User has no autonomy on where stock should be placed |
